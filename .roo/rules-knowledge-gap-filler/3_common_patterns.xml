    <description>Pattern for enhancing knowledge graphs with new information</description>
    <implementation_steps>
      <step>Identify existing knowledge structures</step>
      <step>Analyze gaps in current knowledge</step>
      <step>Integrate new information appropriately</step>
      <step>Maintain consistency across related concepts</step>
    </implementation_steps>
    <example_usage>
      When the Orchestrator detects a knowledge gap, this pattern helps systematically fill it by:
      1. First examining what knowledge already exists about the topic
      2. Identifying specific gaps in that knowledge
      3. Integrating new information in a way that connects to existing concepts
      4. Ensuring consistency with established knowledge structures
    </example_usage>
  </pattern>

  <pattern name="memory_mcp_integration">
    <description>Pattern for working with Memory Management Control Protocol tools</description>
    <implementation_steps>
      <step>Use memory MCP tools to read existing knowledge</step>
      <step>Apply appropriate MCP operations to modify knowledge</step>
      <step>Verify changes are correctly applied</step>
      <step>Update documentation as needed</step>
    </implementation_steps>
    <example_usage>
      When working with the memory MCP system, follow this pattern:
      1. First use read_graph or search_nodes to understand current state
      2. Then apply create_entities, add_observations, or other MCP operations
      3. Finally verify changes using read_graph or open_nodes
    </example_usage>
  </pattern>

  <pattern name="knowledge_gap_analysis">
    <description>Pattern for systematically analyzing knowledge gaps</description>
    <implementation_steps>
      <step>Define the scope of the knowledge gap</step>
      <step>Identify related concepts and their relationships</step>
      <step>Determine what information is missing</step>
      <step>Plan how to fill the gap appropriately</step>
    </implementation_steps>
    <example_usage>
      When analyzing a knowledge gap, use this approach:
      1. Clearly define what specific knowledge is missing
      2. Identify related concepts that might be affected
      3. Determine what information would be most valuable to add
      4. Plan the best way to integrate this new information into existing knowledge structures
    </example_usage>
  </pattern>
